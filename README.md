## 2. L2 Regularization
Demonstrates the use of L2 regularization in regression models, with an implementation of Ridge Regression and a comparison of model performance.

## 3. Logistic Regression
Manual implementation of logistic regression using gradient descent, including cost function and gradient computation.

## 4. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
Shows how to use MLE for parameter estimation in statistical models, with detailed mathematical derivations and practical examples.

## 5. PCA Dimension Reduction
Implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing data dimensionality, including visualizations of explained variance.

## 6. Polynomial Regression
Extends linear regression to include polynomial terms for modeling non-linear relationships, with a comparison of different polynomial degrees.

## 7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Custom implementation of SVM for classification, including the kernel trick and comparisons of decision boundaries.

## 8. Heart Disease Prediction
Predicts heart disease using various machine learning models, with evaluations based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

## 9. KMeans Clustering
Implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm, including visualizations of clusters and centroids.

## Getting Started
